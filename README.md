# Fantasy Point Estimator

The Fantasy point estimator sources NFL data for the last aggregated season (17 games) of production for a player based on runtime,
adjusts their average stats against estimated defensive efficacy, and outputs a CSV of player -> expected fantasy points for all offensive
players in the pulled dataset + aggregate defense.

Eventually will take into account injury reports and recency bias, but learning has to happen before that can.
